## 🌟 About Me  


</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">   
  
🌱 I'm currently exploring Data Structures and Analysis of Algorithms through 50 Days of Coding under #DrGVishwanathan Challenge by VIT Bhopal University. Previously, I've worked on projects focused on healthcare like brain tumor detection using YOLOv11 and skin disease detection with a custom CNN. 

🧠 I'm passionate about current trends in AI, Machine Learning, and how they can be applied to a wide range of fields. I like to learn by hands-on projects to better understand and experiment with these concepts.

🤝 I’m open to collaborating on hands-on projects to explore AI/ML in real-world applications, and research oppurtunities where I can contribute, learn, and grow alongside passionate people in the field.
